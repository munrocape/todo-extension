A Google Chrome extension that takes over the new tab page - and replaces it with a todo list which can have items added, marked as completed, and removed.

You can install it as an extension [here.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mytodo/gljgcpcoddamhjlokabkcgkcnacicglh)

## Using Google Chrome?
Try it out [in your browser!](https://munrocape.github.io/todo-extension/src/todo.html)

Even try refreshing the page or opening it in a new tab - your list will persist across different sessions. 

Click anywhere on "What's next?" to enter an item. 

Click on the green tick to complete a task and on the red trash to then delete it.
